/*
This program check weather the user Input(ineger) is a Composite number or Not. Also Print Composite Numbers upto given number.

A Composite number is a positive integer that is not prime. In other words, it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.

The composite numbers up to 20 are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.

For example:

Input: 10
Output: yes (10 has divisors other than 1 and itself, for example, 2 or 5).

Input: 5
Output: no (5 is a prime number because it has no other divisors other than 1 and itself).
